## Topic of our Research Paper - Is Less the Merrier for Ad Exposure and Audience Attention? A Media Measurement Case Study​
+The way audiences consume content changes as technologies evolve. One noteworthy change is the decline we’ve observed in audience attention to ads, defined in this research as completion rate.
+There is evidence of a shift toward 15-second ads and away from 30 second ads in recent years (Abcarian & Rao, in progress). Do changes in ad duration over time fully account for the observed decline in audience attention to ads?
+Do changes in other ad spot characteristics (e.g., network, daypart, day of the week) account for the observed decline in audience attention? This research seeks to answer these questions.
